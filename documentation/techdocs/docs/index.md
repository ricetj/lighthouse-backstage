# Introduction to TechDocs

TechDocs is Spotifyâ€™s homegrown docs-like-code solution built directly into Backstage. This means engineers write their documentation in Markdown files which live together with their code.

This is an introduction to our TechDocs implementation and how to build documentation components for Backstage. You can find information on the underlying architecture of TechDocs [here](https://backstage.io/docs/features/techdocs/architecture). TechDocs are generated from markdown files using the [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/#adding-pages) static site generator.
